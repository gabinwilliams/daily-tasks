Detailed Analysis and Test Fixes
iOS Mobile App Test Fixes
The iOS app is critical for user interaction, and several test files require attention for functionality and coverage, particularly given the reported problems with tests.
File: DailyTasks/Tests/ViewModels/TaskListViewModelTests.swift
Issue: Missing tests for task statistics functionality, with TaskListViewModel lacking a method to fetch task statistics, causing test failures or incomplete coverage.
Analysis: The provided tests cover task fetching and updates but do not test the statistics feature, which is crucial for analytics. The TaskStatisticsView expects viewModel.taskStats, but the view model lacks this property and method, leading to potential runtime errors.
Fix Instructions:
Open DailyTasks/ViewModels/TaskListViewModel.swift.
Add the taskStats property:
swift
@Published var taskStats: TaskStats?
Implement the fetchTaskStats(timeRange:) method:
swift
func fetchTaskStats(timeRange: TimeRange) async {
    isLoadingStats = true
    error = nil

    do {
        taskStats = try await taskManager.getTaskStats(timeRange: timeRange)
        isLoadingStats = false
    } catch {
        self.error = error
        taskStats = nil
        isLoadingStats = false
    }
}
Ensure TaskManager has a getTaskStats(timeRange: TimeRange) method that fetches statistics from the backend via APIClient.
Open DailyTasks/Tests/ViewModels/TaskListViewModelTests.swift.
Add a test method to check successful fetching of task statistics:
swift
func testFetchTaskStatsSuccess() async {
    // Given
    let mockStats = TaskStats(
        totalTasks: 10,
        completedTasks: 5,
        approvedTasks: 3,
        rejectedTasks: 2,
        pendingTasks: 5,
        dailyStats: []
    )
    mockTaskManager.mockTaskStats = mockStats

    // When
    await viewModel.fetchTaskStats(timeRange: .week)

    // Then
    XCTAssertFalse(viewModel.isLoadingStats)
    XCTAssertNil(viewModel.error)
    XCTAssertEqual(viewModel.taskStats?.totalTasks, 10)
    // Add more assertions as needed
}
Add a test for error cases:
swift
func testFetchTaskStatsFailure() async {
    // Given
    let expectedError = NSError(domain: "test", code: -1, userInfo: [NSLocalizedDescriptionKey: "Test error"])
    mockTaskManager.mockError = expectedError

    // When
    await viewModel.fetchTaskStats(timeRange: .week)

    // Then
    XCTAssertFalse(viewModel.isLoadingStats)
    XCTAssertNotNil(viewModel.error)
    XCTAssertNil(viewModel.taskStats)
}
Ensure MockTaskManager is updated to handle getTaskStats() calls, returning mockTaskStats or throwing mockError as needed.
Run the tests using Xcode's test navigator to verify they pass, addressing any failures by debugging the implementation.
File: DailyTasks/Tests/Managers/NotificationManagerTests.swift
Issue: Tests may fail due to incorrect mocking of UNUserNotificationCenter, especially for authorization and scheduling.
Analysis: The tests use a MockUserNotificationCenter, but if the mock doesn't handle all scenarios, tests might fail, particularly for authorization states or scheduling reminders.
Fix Instructions:
Open DailyTasks/Tests/Managers/NotificationManagerTests.swift.
Verify that MockUserNotificationCenter handles all UNAuthorizationStatus cases, including .denied, .notDetermined, and .authorized.
Ensure the mock correctly simulates requestAuthorization() and add(_:) methods, returning appropriate results.
Add tests for edge cases, such as scheduling reminders when unauthorized:
swift
func testScheduleTaskReminderUnauthorized() async {
    // Given
    mockNotificationCenter.authorizationStatus = .denied
    let task = createMockTask()
    let date = Date().addingTimeInterval(3600)

    // When/Then
    do {
        try await notificationManager.scheduleTaskReminder(
            for: task,
            at: date,
            type: .upcoming
        )
        XCTFail("Should throw error when notifications are not authorized")
    } catch {
        XCTAssertEqual(error as? NotificationError, .notAuthorized)
    }
}
Run tests and debug any failures, ensuring the mock aligns with real-world behavior.
Serverless Backend Test Fixes
The backend, managed via AWS CDK and Lambda functions, requires comprehensive tests to ensure reliability, particularly given the integration with AWS services.
File: test/lambda/tasks/index.test.ts
Issue: Tests may lack coverage for error scenarios or AWS service interactions, leading to potential failures.
Analysis: Lambda functions interact with DynamoDB and other AWS services, and tests need to mock these interactions using aws-sdk-client-mock. Incomplete mocking can cause tests to fail or miss critical paths.
Fix Instructions:
Open test/lambda/tasks/index.test.ts.
Ensure aws-sdk-client-mock is used to mock DynamoDBClient for operations like scan and putItem.
Add tests for successful GET tasks:
ts
it('should handle GET tasks successfully', async () => {
    mockClient(DynamoDBClient).on('scan').returns({
        Items: [
            // mock task items
        ],
        Count: 2,
        ScannedCount: 2
    });

    const event: APIGatewayProxyEvent = {
        httpMethod: 'GET',
        path: '/tasks',
        queryStringParameters: { limit: '20' }
    };

    const result: APIGatewayProxyResult = await handler(event, {} as any, {} as any);

    expect(result.statusCode).toBe(200);
    expect(result.body).toContain('tasks');
});
Add tests for error cases, such as DynamoDB timeouts:
ts
it('should handle DynamoDB errors', async () => {
    mockClient(DynamoDBClient).on('scan').rejects(new Error('DynamoDB timeout'));

    const event: APIGatewayProxyEvent = {
        httpMethod: 'GET',
        path: '/tasks'
    };

    const result: APIGatewayProxyResult = await handler(event, {} as any, {} as any);

    expect(result.statusCode).toBe(500);
    expect(result.body).toContain('Internal server error');
});
Run tests using npm test and debug any failures, ensuring mocks cover all service interactions.
File: test/stacks/daily-tasks-stack.test.ts
Issue: Stack tests may not verify resource creation or permissions, leading to deployment issues.
Analysis: CDK stack tests should verify resource properties and IAM roles, ensuring the infrastructure is set up correctly.
Fix Instructions:
Open test/stacks/daily-tasks-stack.test.ts.
Add tests to verify Cognito User Pool creation:
ts
it('should create Cognito User Pool with correct settings', () => {
    const app = new cdk.App();
    const stack = new DailyTasksStack(app, 'TestStack');
    expect(stack).toHaveResource('AWS::Cognito::UserPool', {
        UserPoolName: 'daily-tasks-users',
        SelfSignUpEnabled: false
    });
});
Ensure tests cover S3 bucket encryption and DynamoDB table creation.
Run tests and address any failures by adjusting the stack implementation.
Raspberry Pi Network Controller Test Fixes
The Raspberry Pi controller manages network access, requiring robust tests to ensure API endpoints and system interactions are reliable.
File: raspberry-pi/src/index.test.ts
Issue: Missing tests for /network/allow and /network/block endpoints, with potential incomplete mocking of child_process.exec.
Analysis: The tests cover authentication and health checks but lack coverage for critical network control endpoints. Mocking exec is essential to test iptables commands without system modifications.
Fix Instructions:
Open raspberry-pi/src/index.test.ts.
Mock child_process.exec to capture commands:
ts
jest.mock('child_process', () => ({
    exec: jest.fn((command, options, callback) => {
        console.log('Executing command:', command);
        if (callback) {
            callback(null, '', '');
        }
        return undefined as any;
    }),
}));
Add tests for allowing a device:
ts
it('should allow device access', async () => {
    const validToken = jwt.sign({ role: 'parent' }, 'test-secret');
    const validMacAddress = '00:11:22:33:44:55';

    const response = await request(app)
        .post('/network/allow')
        .set('Authorization', `Bearer ${validToken}`)
        .send({ macAddress: validMacAddress });

    expect(response.status).toBe(200);
    expect(response.body).toStrictEqual({
        message: 'Device access allowed',
        macAddress: validMacAddress,
    });
    expect(exec).toHaveBeenCalledWith(
        expect.stringContaining(`sudo iptables -A FORWARD -i eth0 -m mac --mac-source ${validMacAddress} -j ACCEPT`)
    );
});
Add tests for blocking a device, similar to the above, verifying the iptables -D command.
Run tests using npm test and debug any failures, ensuring mocks align with expected behavior.
General Considerations
Beyond specific files, several overarching areas require attention for testing:
Security: Ensure tests verify encrypted communications and secure data handling, particularly for authentication and network control.
Error Handling: Tests should cover error scenarios, such as network timeouts or unauthorized access, providing comprehensive coverage.
Test Coverage: Use tools like Jest coverage for the backend and Xcode coverage for iOS to ensure all critical paths are tested.
Documentation: Update test documentation in README.md to reflect changes, ensuring setup instructions are clear for users, as seen in docs/raspberry-pi/setup.md.
